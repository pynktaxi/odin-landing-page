CSS-Flexbox Project: Demonstrate understanding and create a website landing page

In this project, I created a test landing page.  This followed a general design given by the odin project, and a style sheet.
The largest challenges faced were making decisions on font when there were none listed in the stylesheet.

That and making margins and padding match so it visually and responsively matched the design given.
